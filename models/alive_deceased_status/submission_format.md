## Alive or Deceased Status

Participants are asked to submit a normalized confidence score, between 0 and 1, for each synthetic Veteran’s COVID-19 status. A value of 1 indicates confidence that the synthetic Veteran is alive, while a value of 0 indicates confidence that the synthetic Veteran died as a result of COVID-19 illness. Veterans without COVID-19 should be given a value of 1.
